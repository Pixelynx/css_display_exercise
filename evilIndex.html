        <h3>Hardest Bug So Far</h3>
        <p>
          Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag
          clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little
          Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
          mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No?
          Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're
          in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.

          Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This
          gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you
          believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes
          with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually
          proud of that shit.

          The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities
          of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the
          name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley
          of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
          lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance
          and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My
          brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance
          upon thee.
